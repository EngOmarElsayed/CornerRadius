# CornerRadius
Unfortunately, For no reasons apple decided to deprecate the .cornerRadius() Modifier in iOS 17. One of the best Modifiers ..... So I decided to make my own .cornerRadius() Modifier.

But when I used .cornerRadius() Modifier in the past, I always asked my self what if I want to change the radius of only one corner, what I should do ? ü§î

So I decided to build it, a modifier where you can specify the corner you want to edit and live the rest and to add some cherry üçí on the top, You also can specify the color of the background, without having the need to specify the cornerRadius and use another modifier to edit the background with it. All in one modifier.

Last this I want to say is: Thank you Apple for challenging me ‚ò∫Ô∏è
